# Bench results — device mapping

This folder contains benchmark outputs and plots.

Device mapping:
- directml:0 / privateuseone:0 — AMD Radeon RX 9070 (external)
- directml:1 / privateuseone:1 — AMD Radeon 780M (integrated)

Files:
- `*.csv` : merged benchmark CSVs
- `*_summary_*.json` : run summaries
- `*_plot*.png` : plots generated from runs

Usage:
- Inspect CSV/JSON for per-run medians and times.
- Use `tools/plot_with_labels.py` to regenerate plots if needed.
